# Retain Cycles and Memory Leaks in Objective-C

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Objective-C: retain cycles leading to memory leaks.  The example showcases how improper management of delegates and blocks can prevent objects from being deallocated, ultimately consuming excessive memory.

The `RetainCycleBug.m` file contains the buggy code, exhibiting the retain cycle.  The `RetainCycleBugSolution.m` file demonstrates a corrected version using techniques like weak references and techniques to avoid circular retain cycles. 

Understanding and avoiding retain cycles is crucial for building robust and memory-efficient Objective-C applications.
